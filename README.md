# About this repository

This repository is to keep track and maintain a personal library of algorithms and data structures in the C programming language. It is also a chance for me to practice and get better at writing said algorithms and data structures.

# Other things

I may update the todo list to include more algorithms and data structures as I see fit. So, the list may grow over time.

# FAQs

**Q:** *Can I use this for my projects?*<br/>
**A:** Maybe, at the moment I prefer you not just because I would rather have it be good enough before saying so.<br/>

**Q:** *Can I contribute?*<br/>
**A:** Again, maybe. It depends. This is mainly because my plan is to do this myself for personal growth purposes, but it really depends. Maybe once I feel it has matured enough or I've completed most of the items I may allow contributions.
